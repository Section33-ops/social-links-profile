## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced using css flex.

```css
main {
  display: flex; /* Enables flexbox */
  justify-content: center; /* Centers items horizontally */
  align-items: center; /* Centers items vertically */
  flex-direction: column; /* Optional: Stack items vertically (like text below an image) */
  min-height: 200px;
}
```

### Continued development

- I would like to make the page more responsive
- I would like to match it with the design
